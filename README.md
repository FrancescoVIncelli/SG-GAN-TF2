# SG-GAN-TF2
The project shows the improvements in semantic segmentation on a dataset of real-world urban images for autonomouse driving task, using recent Generative Adversarial Network model architectures (such as Grad-GAN and Pix2Pix) which can produce better results against the traditional fully-connected and convolutional discriminative models.  

### Dataset
The images used to train the models are extracted form [The Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/), a large-scale dataset that contains a diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in street scenes.  
The whole dataset contains images sequences acquired in urban scenarios from 50 different cities, with high quality pixel-level annotations of 5 000 frames in addition to a larger set of 20 000 weakly annotated frames.

### Installation Procedure

- Clone the entire repository in a specific path in the PC or in MATLAB online
- The repository already contains the datasets of an individual. To add different test samples, add in the [data](data/) directory. Make sure to edit the [dataset_load.m](code/dataset_load.m) script to use different dataset. The code snippet to edit is shown below. 
```objective-c
[data1,header1] =  lab_read_edf(fullfile('..','data','edf_file_name'));
```

### Documentation
This project perfroms a sequence of steps as shown below
1. Three parameters `(Frequency1, Frequency2 and density)` are set
2. The dataset is loaded using [dataset_load.m](code/dataset_load.m) script
3. The pixel positions for plotting the graph is loaded which is stored as a `.mat` file using [get_node_pose.m](code/get_node_pose.m) script 
4. The `run_routine` function is called multiple times by changing the dataset, frequecny and number of channels which performs a series of steps
   1. Computes Multi-Variate Autoregressive model and then Partial Directed Coherence to obtain a 3D matrics. One frequency is choosen from the 3D matrics and converted to binary matrix by setting a threshold to obtain given density
   2. Computes the local indices (in-degree, out-degree, degree, left and right hemisphere density)
   3. Computes the global indices (global efficiency and local efficiency)
   4. Computes the graph (edges and nodes) for plotting the graph
   5. Stores all the obtained results into a data structure
5. Finally, all the results are plotted by running their respective plot scripts

### Execution of the code
- The only file that is to be run is the [main.m](code/main.m) file. Make sure to select the current path to be [code](code/) before running the script
- The [main.m](code/main.m) file contains "Initialize Parameters" section where the frequencies and densities are to be set 
- To get the plots, individual scripts have to be run to get degrees, densities and efficiency plots. Each of them has comparision functions in which individual samples can be comparte with the others. Make sure to uncomment the necessary plot before running the script. 

### Limitations
- The code is code to work for 21 channels and 64 channels. The indices should be updated if the number of channels are different
- The project computes only the general kind of PDC (Baccalà and Sameshima, 2001) and one kind of normalization technique (Astolfi et al, 2007). Other PDC computation techniques can be implemented to get better results
- All the plots are coded to work for only this application will have to be slightly modified based on the requirements. The functions are general which can be used for a differnt application with slight modification
